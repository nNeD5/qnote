# qnote â€” quick notes

# What is it

Two scripts:

- odw open week notes
- odd open daily notes

Just my way to make notes.

Store notes like:

- ~/Note/{year}{month}{week}week_index.md 
- ~/Note/{year}{month}{week}{day_of_the_month}.md

# Why

Just try to use helix instead of neovim and it doesn't have any plugin that suit me.

# Warning

It's just thing which I done for myself, so to some value is hardcoded.
But it should very easy, to change them directly in code, as scripts really small.
